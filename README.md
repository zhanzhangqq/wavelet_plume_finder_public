# Wavelet plume finder 
This repository contains the code for point source plume masking based on denoising a methane concentration image using wavelet transform techniques. Given a methane concentration image, the code extracts the high-frequency pixels by conducting wavelet transform and inverse wavelet transform. Then it subtracts the high-frequencies from the original image, assuming that the high-frequencies are mainly background noise. The resulting image is expected to be much "cleaner", thus is named "denoised image". Next, we create plume masks by selecting high-value pixels from the image. The resulting masks then go through three main filters: "hotspot" filter, wind direction filter, and shape filter. The masks passing all these filters are preserved in the end.
